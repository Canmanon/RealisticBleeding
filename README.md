# Building
1. Download and install the mod in your Blade & Sorcery installation.
2. Create a new environment variable on your system named `BladeAndSorceryInstallPath` and point it to the root Blade & Sorcery installation folder.

After that, the project should build. There's an AfterBuild task that will copy the `RealisticBleeding.dll` into the `BladeAndSorcery_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods\RealisticBleeding` folder.
